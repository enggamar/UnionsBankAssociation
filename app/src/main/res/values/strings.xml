    <string name="about_us_text">Association is the oldest and largest national trade union Centre of bank employees in India, was founded in 1946 on the 20th of April in Kolkata. They were being paid paltry wages with no regulated service conditions at all. It was a rule of hire and fire. Bank empgroaning but did not have the necessary courage to form unions. They saw the workers in the factories fighting and making some progress in terms of wages and betterment in service conditions. Bank employees also gathered some courage here and there and started to organize themselves into unions in a sporadic way. Some protest actions and strikes were undertaken but the disputes were referred to tribunals and employees did not get justice or satisfaction. Hence unrest and dissatisfaction amongst the employees were brewing and many Unions were formed during the period. With the advent of AIBEA on the scene, this gave a fillip to the formation of unions in different banks. With the formation of the Unions, there were innumerable agitations, struggles and strikes in the banks. Banking was a State subject at that time and hence there were number of Tribunals and Awards. The growing discontentment amongst the bank employees was sensed by the management and the authorities and banking was made a central subject.</string>

    <string name="disciplinary_action_data">The procedure for taking any disciplinary action against employees is well-defined and codified under the Bipartite Settlement dated 10th April, 2002 between the Union and the management (IBA).The nature of charges that can be leveled against the employees is categorized and grouped as Major Misconduct and Minor Misconduct.Types of punishments that management can impose on the employees for any proven misconduct are also defined in the Settlement.Management has to follow the set procedure and prove the charges before imposing punishment.\n\n
Employee has the right to be defended by the Union.\n\n
Hence whenever any memo, charge-sheet, show-cause letter is given to any employee, the union should be contacted. No reply or any statement or apology letter should be given without consulting the Union. Union will guide the employees to submit suitable reply.Employees should learn and be thorough with their work, rules and procedures, be courteous to customers and superiors, follow the laid down instructions, etc. so that no room is given for any disciplinary action.Special caution is necessary while working in the computers like non-handing over the password, etc., to avoid misuse by others.
